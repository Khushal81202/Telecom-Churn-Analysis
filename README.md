Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Overview

This project aims to analyze telecom customer churn data to identify factors influencing customer retention. The analysis focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extracting insights.

Dataset

The dataset contains customer details such as tenure, contract type, monthly charges, total charges, and whether they have churned.

Data is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

Steps Involved

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and incorrect data types.

Encoding categorical features.

Scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing customer distribution and churn patterns.

Identifying key factors influencing churn.

Insights & Observations:

Understanding customer behavior trends.

Providing data-driven recommendations to reduce churn.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Future Improvements

Implement machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for churn prediction.

Optimize feature selection for improved accuracy.
